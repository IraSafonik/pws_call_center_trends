- **Trend Analysis**: Identify and visualize long-term trends in both customer and agent behavior to facilitate data-driven decision-making.
- **Agent Performance**: Highlight agent performance metrics to identify top performers and areas needing improvement.

## üíº Tasks

1. Collect and preprocess call center data.
2. Identify and define relevant KPIs.
3. Design and develop a Power BI dashboard to visualize these KPIs.
4. Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly and provides actionable insights.
5. Collaborate with the Call Centre Manager to refine and adjust the dashboard as needed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For initial data collection and preprocessing.
- **Python (optional)**: For advanced data preprocessing if needed.

## üåüInsights:

### Overall Call Center Statistics
- The average satisfaction rating for the period is 3.40 out of 5.
- 81.08% of calls were answered, while 18.92% were unanswered.
- 72.92% of calls were resolved successfully, while 27.08% were unresolved.
- The average speed of answering a call was 67.52 seconds.
